### Open-source deploy (Advanced)

Deploy Visio on your own infrastructure using [our self-hosting guide](https://github.com/suitenumerique/meet/blob/main/docs/installation.md). Our open-source deployment is optimized for Kubernetes, and we're working on supporting additional deployment options. Keycloak integration and any SSO are supported. We offer customer support for open-source setupsâ€”just reach out for assistance.  

## Docs

We're currently working on both technical and user documentation for Visio. In the meantime, many of the essential aspects are already well covered by the [LiveKit documentation](https://docs.livekit.io/home/) and their [self-hosting guide](https://docs.livekit.io/home/self-hosting/deployment/). Stay tuned for more updates!

## Philosophy

Weâ€™re relentlessly focused on building the best open-source video conferencing productâ€”Visio. Growth comes from creating something people truly need, not just from chasing metrics.

Our users come first. Weâ€™re committed to making Visio as accessible and easy to use as proprietary solutions, ensuring it meets the highest standards.

Most of the heavy engineering is handled by the incredible LiveKit team, allowing us to focus on delivering a top-tier product. We follow extreme programming practices, favoring pair programming and quick, iterative releases. Challenge our tech and architectureâ€”simplicity is always our top priority.
